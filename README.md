This is an optimization program that attempts to find the absolute minimum of a three dimensional function by generating a large amount of particles and calculating which particle's position is the best based on the fitness function. Based on the best position, the program will then find the velocity of each of the particles based on their position. Then, the algorithm will continue until the difference between the best fitness of the current iteration and the best fitness of previous iteration is 10e-8.
